**Business Strategy**  
The "Business jargon" website defines Business Strategy as the following. "**Business strategy** can be understood as the course of action or set of decisions which assist the entrepreneurs in achieving specific business objectives."   
In their article about business strategy they describe its three levels. Corporate, business and functional. These three levels tend to be more obvious in larger businesses. This can also be seen as top down decision structures.   
Having tech involved in business strategy assists with gathering data on the status of businesses which can then be used in decisions made for the company. Tech can also make changes made by these decisions done efficiently. 

**Organisational Culture**  
"**Organizational culture** is a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs, which governs how people behave in organizations. These shared values have a strong influence on the people in the organization and dictate how they dress, act, and perform their jobs. Every organization develops and maintains a unique culture, which provides guidelines and boundaries for the behavior of the members of the organization."   
The definition above comes from study.com. Their article goes into further detail about how having a healthy organisational culture of a business helps keep morale up and further more higher work efficiency. It's described that there are seven attributes of organisational culture.   
Innovation, Attention to detail, Emphasis on Outcome, Emphasis on People, Teamwork, Aggressiveness and Stability.
