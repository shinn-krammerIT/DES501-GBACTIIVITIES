# Activity 1.3

[https://www.seek.co.nz/job/40919337?type=promoted\#searchRequestToken=19e2efb9-7b04-4dc2-9314-6e24e151bda4](https://www.seek.co.nz/job/40919337?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=19e2efb9-7b04-4dc2-9314-6e24e151bda4)  
A data solutions developer would be a great high end position to hold as I have an interest in databases and Drive Systems Architecture. The pay is good however being based wellington is preferable for me personally.

This position looks for a experienced senior full stack developer. It lists the team they are looking for and how many developers you will be working with. It requires that you are experienced in JS, TypeScript and react. However it does not specify the length of operation, payment or specific trade industry you are working in. My assumption is that you will be making a website and cloud based custom software for a trade agency. Another thing to point out is they ask for 5+ years commercial experience but that "Development is not your job, itâ€™s a passion, your hobby."

This ad goes into a lot of detail in their responsibilities list. Being really specific in their requirements. They don't give a length of the fixed term they describe or payment details. They want a systems engineer that specialize in cloud infrastructure and maintenance. Specifically, on windows servers, MS SQL databases, automation scripting, application maintenance and overall management skills for a engineering team.
