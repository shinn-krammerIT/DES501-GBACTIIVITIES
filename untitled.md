# Activity 1.5

Information technology can significantly affect the strategic options, opportunities and issues in many aspects of business. Some of the key impacts of technology are:

* business strategy
* organisational culture
* organisational structure
* business processes
* the nature of work
* the workplace

You are required to:

1. Do your own web research on all of the above.
2. Discuss in the Class OneNote how they can be impacted by technology.

**Business Strategy**  
The "Business jargon" website defines Business Strategy as the following. "**Business strategy** can be understood as the course of action or set of decisions which assist the entrepreneurs in achieving specific business objectives."   
In their article about business strategy they describe its three levels. Corporate, business and functional. These three levels tend to be more obvious in larger businesses. This can also be seen as top down decision structures.   
Having tech involved in business strategy assists with gathering data on the status of businesses which can then be used in decisions made for the company. Tech can also make changes made by these decisions done efficiently. 

**Organisational Culture**  
"**Organizational culture** is a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs, which governs how people behave in organizations. These shared values have a strong influence on the people in the organization and dictate how they dress, act, and perform their jobs. Every organization develops and maintains a unique culture, which provides guidelines and boundaries for the behavior of the members of the organization."   
The definition above comes from study.com. Their article goes into further detail about how having a healthy organisational culture of a business helps keep morale up and further more higher work efficiency. It's described that there are seven attributes of organisational culture.   
Innovation, Attention to detail, Emphasis on Outcome, Emphasis on People, Teamwork, Aggressiveness and Stability. 

**Organisational Structure**  
"An organizational structure is a system that outlines how certain activities are directed in order to achieve the goals of an organization. These activities can include rules, roles, and responsibilities." - Investopedia

**Business Process**  
"A business process is a collection of linked tasks which find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client.   A business process has also been defined as a set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal.  The process must involve clearly defined inputs and a single output. These inputs are made up of all of the factors which contribute \(either directly or indirectly\) to the added value of a service or product. These factors can be categorized into management processes, operational processes and supporting business processes." - appian

**The nature of Work**  
Chron states that the level of a person's work is often directly connected to the nature of their work. If a job is matched to them then they will work better.
